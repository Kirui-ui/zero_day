# Welcome to My First Repository as a Full-Stack Engineer!

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository, "zero_day." This repository marks the beginning of my journey as a full-stack engineer, and I'm excited to share my progress and projects with you.

## About Me

I'm passionate about web development, both on the front end and back end. As I embark on this journey, I'll be learning and working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and more. I believe in continuous learning and improvement, and I'll be using this repository to document my learning process and showcase my projects.

## Repository Contents

At the moment, this repository is just getting started. You'll find the following files and information:

- **README.md**: You're reading it right now! This file provides an introduction to the repository and its purpose.

## Get in Touch

I'm eager to connect with fellow developers, learners, and enthusiasts. If you have any questions, suggestions, or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon!
